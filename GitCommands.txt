git commands from basic to advanced.
or 
play here https://learngitbranching.js.org

to initialise a empty local git repo:
# git init

to configure your username & email to the local git:
# git config --global user.name user-name
# git config --global user.email email

to add new git url to local git:
# git remote add origin url-of-new-repo
# git push origin branch-name-usually-master/main-as-per-convension

to create a new branch:
# git branch new-branch-name  - is always created from the HEAD- which is the pointer to your working tree

to point your head or upcoming commits to your desired branch:
# git checkout branch-name

to see the status of the working tree:
# git status

to add the changes to staging area:
# git add file-name/s

to update or commit to local git:
# git commit -m "commit meassage"

to add to stash area:
# git add .
# git stash

to add the stash to working directory/modified area:
# git stash pop

to clear the stash:
# git add .
# git stash clear

to see last commits;
# git log

to reset to a particular commit:
# git reset commit-id
again you have to push to origin

to clone a forked project/any remote project
# git clone repo-url

to set/add the upstream repo-url
# git remote add upstream repo-url

to see the branches:
# git remote -v

when you have the upstream code commits more than the remote repo commits
to make both even:
# git fetch --all --prune  -will fetch all the branches and prune for deleted also
# git reset --hard upstream/main   -will reset the main branch of local to the main branch of upstream
# git push origin main -- will push the local changes to remote.
or can do it in github website

to merge the commits to one single commit:
can reset to that particular commit and add and commit all to single commit
or 
# git rebase -i commit-id   -you can pick the commit id/s and use 's' for squash to commits to get merge your changes to the 'pick commit id above squash commit-ids'
whichever squash commits are there gets merged into previous pick commit-id
use escape, : & x to come out of interactive environment

to merge the 2 branches means to have a another commit which points to both the commits from the either branches.
when you have 2 branches running parallel and wants to merge can use:
# git merge other-branch-name
# git checkout other-branch-name
# git merge previous-checkedout-branch
so that now all 2 branches have all the commits in the work.

to have a cleaner linear commit history we can do rebase:
# git rebase other-branch-name

to move around in a commity tree 
HEAD is a reference to the current commint that you are working on top off in your working tree.
to detach HEAD from the branch means pointing HEAD to commit
# git checkout HEAD

to move through the tree use relative references such as the ^ caret for one step backwards and ~ tiddle to specify the number of times we want to move on with the branch or HEAD.
# git checkout HEAD^/HEAD^^
# git checkout HEAD~3

to force move the branch
# git branch -f main HEAD~3

to revert the changes in the history:
# git reset commit-id/HEAD~1/HEAD^  -- will reset the reference of branch to the specified commit-id so the git think the commits after this is ignored wririting the history which is in local.
# git revert commit-id/HEAD~1/HEAD^   --will add another commit saying reverting the commit and can be pushed to remote.


to just add the commits after the current commit from different branches you can just cherry-pick:
# git cherry-pick c1 c2 c3 cn

when you dont know what commits u want to apply: use interactive rebase
# git rebase -i HEAD~4/commit-id --then you can reorder them or pick or squash them into single commit.


to tag a particular commit:
# git tag name commit-id  --usually to represent a particular milestone in the history of project. tags cant move like branches in history.

# git describe
will be closest-tag_branch_g-commit-hash
